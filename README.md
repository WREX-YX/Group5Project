# Sudoku
##### A simple soduku game
A sudoku game made using arrays where an initial array and a final array are set. The initial array is the solvable sudoku board where the user will guess the missing numbers, and the system will check the responses to see if they match the final array. This program will work by checking inputs for the rows and columns and sets a new value. 

As of now, we are able to get user input for each cell, and have a check to make sure the uuser doesn't over lay values. In the future, we will add functionality to check the individual/groups of rows and columns to make sure no values are respeated
